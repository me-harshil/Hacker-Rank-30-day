/*Given a list of integers prices representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, return the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

Note: You are not required to buy or sell the stock. example: Input Length of prices = 6 prices = [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10] Output 5 Explanation You can buy at 5 and sell at 10. As 5 is the minimum price of the stock we may buy at 5 and sell at 10 as it is increasing. our profit might have been zero if the price would have decreased.
